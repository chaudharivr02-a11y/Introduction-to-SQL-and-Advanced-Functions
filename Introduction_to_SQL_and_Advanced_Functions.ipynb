        "of constraints, providing a simple scenario where each would be useful.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**ANSWER:** The primary purpose of SQL constraints is to enforce data integrity. They act as a set of rules applied to a table’s columns to ensure that the data entered into the database is accurate, reliable, and consistent. By preventing \"bad\" data from being saved, constraints maintain the quality of the information throughout its lifecycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "3 Common SQL Constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "I. NOT NULL:\n",
        "\n",
        "This constraint ensures that a column cannot have a NULL (empty) value. It forces a field to always contain a value, which is essential for mandatory information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Scenario: Imagine you are building a User Profiles table. You would apply the NOT NULL constraint to the username and email columns. You wouldn't want a user to successfully register without providing these two pieces of vital information.\n",
        "\n",
        "II. UNIQUE:\n",
        "\n",
        "The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different from one another. This prevents duplicate entries in specific fields while allowing the rest of the row's data to be similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Scenario: In an Employee database, while two people might share the same name (e.g., \"John Smith\"), they should never share the same Social Security Number or Employee ID. Applying a UNIQUE constraint to the SSN column ensures that no two employees can be assigned the same identification number.\n",
        "\n",
        "III. FOREIGN KEY:\n",
        "\n",
        "A FOREIGN KEY is a field in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Its purpose is to maintain referential integrity by ensuring that a relationship between two tables remains valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Scenario: Suppose you have a Customers table and an Orders table. The Orders table would have a CustomerID column. By making this a FOREIGN KEY linked to the Customers table, the database prevents anyone from creating an order for a customer who doesn't actually exist in your system."

        "\n",
